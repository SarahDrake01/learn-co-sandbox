This is my readme file
* Change into your `code` directory: `cd ~/code`
  * If your development directory is named something other than `~/code`, that's fine, `cd` into whatever yours is called.
* Create a new directory named `my_new_directory`: `mkdir my_new_directory`
* Change into the newly-created directory: `cd my_new_directory`
* Create a new file named `README.md`: `touch README.md`
* Add some text to the new file: `echo "This is my readme file" > README.md`
